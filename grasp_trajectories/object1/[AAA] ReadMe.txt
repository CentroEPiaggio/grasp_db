Taking from the iros-db commit grasp 37 -> renamed to 1 and generated all others based on bootstrap_cylinder_db app

There is also a side_high grasp [grasp2 (original side grasp)] which can be used depending on the compile flag DO_SIDE_GRASPS in bootstrap_cylinder_db app : rename it to grasp2 if want to use it!
